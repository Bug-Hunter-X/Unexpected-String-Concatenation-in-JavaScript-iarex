This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving unexpected string concatenation due to loose typing.  The `foo` function intends to add two numbers, but it unexpectedly concatenates strings when given mixed number and string inputs. The solution shows how to explicitly type check or use the `parseInt()` function to avoid this issue. This is a great example of why explicit type checking or type safety is beneficial, even in dynamically typed languages.
